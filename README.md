# New York Times Hierarchical Classification Dataset

Original source: https://github.com/yumeng5/WeSHClass/tree/master/nyt

I split the dataset into 80:20 split with a fixed seed to ensure reproduceability.

Each category is a separate folder. The number of documents is not balanced. With the most number of documents under sports.
